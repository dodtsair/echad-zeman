<p>Day two. Still lost in the wilderness. Now I have multiple maps, but the legend to each seems to be in a strange language I don't understand. Hopefully I can decode it before I'm forced to eat my own leg.</p>

<!--<p>I have no idea what's going on</p>
<p>And now I can figure out how I got here. I'm seeing files(I think?) I couldn't see before, and can't find the file/link that brought me here in the first place.</p>
<p>Remind me to delete that ^ next time I make an edit.</p>
