<!--<p>Hey- what does that angular/ajax stuff in the head do?</p>-->

<!--<p>I seem to be making a mess of this HTML. I need to think of something to actually add, rather than just editing text for the sake of making changes.</p>-->


<!--<p><b>VVV</b> That's Old News down there. Ignore it.<b>VVV</b></p>

<p><i>Day two. Still lost in the wilderness. Now I have multiple maps, but the legend to each seems to be in a strange language I don't understand. Hopefully I can decode it before I'm forced to eat my own leg.</i></p>
-->
<!--<p>I have no idea what's going on</p>
<p>And now I can figure out how I got here. I'm seeing files(I think?) I couldn't see before, and can't find the file/link that brought me here in the first place.</p>
<p>Remind me to delete that ^ next time I make an edit.</p>
